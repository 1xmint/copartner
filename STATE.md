# State

## 2026-10-17: first version
- Started from a personal shared rules file that was proven to load in fresh
  Claude Code and Codex sessions. Generalised it (no personal or machine
  details) into `rules.md`.
- Project notes live outside the repo so messy repos don't matter. Fallback:
  `NOTES.md` at the repo root if the agent can't write there.
- Install is a page the agent follows (`INSTALL.md`), not scripts, so one
  install works for both tools on any OS.
- Repo is public; `main` requires a PR and a green check, no approvals (one
  maintainer).

## 2026-10-17: judged by real use
- No scripted comparison runs. The owner uses it on real projects and
  reports what could be better; that feedback drives changes. Why: scripted
  runs spend quota and test made-up tasks.

## 2026-10-17: install test, Codex
- A fresh Codex session could not install: its sandbox blocks writes to
  `~/.codex` even when the folder is granted. It wrote the user a one-command
  installer instead, so that is now the documented fallback.
- Codex adds a trust entry to `config.toml` for any folder it runs in; that
  is Codex, not the install.

Known problems:
- Not yet checked: the Claude Code install, and that Codex can write to `~/.copartner` after the
  `writable_roots` change, and that Claude's auto mode allows writing there
  and allows the install itself.

Next:
1. A fresh-session install test in each tool.
2. On-demand skills (plan a big feature, review money/auth code, pick up
   where we left off), only if real use shows a gap they fill.
